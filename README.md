# EBots Coding Challenge #

Benchmarking C++ and Python performance on unsigned integer arithmetic. 

## Running the program ## 

Executing `run.sh` with root privileges should do the trick for you! 

If things aren't working, then dig into run.sh and the 3 commands are just chilling in there. 

## Results ## 

```
C++ runtime: 18901 nanoseconds
Python runtime: 2799034.1186523438 nanoseconds
```
